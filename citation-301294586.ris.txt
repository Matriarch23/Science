N2  - With a cultural and linguistic origin in Island Southeast Asia the
Lapita expansion is thought to have led ultimately to the
Polynesian settlement of the east Polynesian region after a time
of mixing/integration in north Melanesia and a nearly 2,000-y
pause in West Polynesia. One of the major achievements of recent
Lapita research in Vanuatu has been the discovery of the oldest
cemetery found so far in the Pacific at Teouma on the south coast
of Efate Island, opening up new prospects for the biological
definition of the early settlers of the archipelago and of Remote
Oceania in general. Using craniometric evidence from the skeletons in conjunction with archaeological data, we discuss here four
debated issues: the Lapita–Asian connection, the degree of admixture, the Lapita–Polynesian connection, and the question of secondary population movement into Remote Oceania.
